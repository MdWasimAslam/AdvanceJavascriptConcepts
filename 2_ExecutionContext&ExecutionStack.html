// There are two types of execution contexts in JavaScript: global and local. 
    
    //  1. Everything in javascript happens inside Execution Context
    //  2. It has two components 
    //                             - Variable Enviroment  -> Where all variables and functions are stored
    //                             - Thread of exeution   -> Where the code lies and executes line by line
