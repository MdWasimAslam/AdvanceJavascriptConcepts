/*The event loop is a process in JavaScript that helps to make sure that tasks in your program are completed in the right order.

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it can only do one thing at a time. But sometimes, you might have a program that has a lot of different tasks that need to be completed. The event loop helps to manage these tasks so that they get done in the right order.

Here's an example: Let's say you have a program that needs to load a bunch of data from a server. This might take a while, so while the data is loading, the event loop can still handle other tasks, like responding to user input or updating the screen. When the data finishes loading, the event loop will add the task of processing the data to a queue of tasks that need to be completed. The event loop will then go through this queue and make sure that each task is completed in the right order.

The event loop helps to make JavaScript programs more efficient by allowing them to perform multiple tasks at the same time.
