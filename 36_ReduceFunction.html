    //The reduce function in JavaScript is used to take an array of items, and combine them together into a single value. It's similar to a loop where you take the first item in the array, 

    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, currentNumber) {
        return accumulator + currentNumber;
    });

    //let sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);   <- We can write like this as well

    console.log(sum);
