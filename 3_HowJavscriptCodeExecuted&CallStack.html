    /*
    As soon as a whole js code is run, a global execution context is created with two components - Memory & Code.
    
    The first phase is memory creation phase in which it allocates all the memory to variables and functions inside the global space.

    The variables are allocated with undefined in the starting.
    In Case of functions we copy the complete function code and store it inside the memory space.

    In the second phase the code execution phase, JS code runs line by line and stores the defined variable value inside the memory of that variable and it will start invoking the function calls.


    while executing functions then again a local execution context is created with two component memory and code, same as global. It will now store the variable and parameters in the memory and start exeting the code line by line. after the function is finished executing it returns the value and that local execution context is deleted.


    After the completion of the overall code the global execution context is deleted as well.

    // CALL STACK
    // The call stack helps keep track of which function is currently being executed, and which functions are waiting to be executed.
